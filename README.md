# bikeshare
This repository contains-
1. Three csv files with data for three cities- chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- bikeshare.py
## Introduction
This is part of Udacity Python foundation course that uses knowledge of Python's modules- Pandas and Numpy, to make sense of the bike sharing data provided, and answer relevant questions about it.

These files are for Python Foundation Nanodegree Program (project for module 1) on Udacity and uses knowledge of numpy and pandas module to make sense of the bike sharing data provided, and answer relevant questions about it.
## How to use
This repository contains-
1. Three csv files with data for three cities- <i>chicago.csv</i>, <i>new_york_city.csv</i>, <i>washington.csv</i>.
2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- <i>bikeshare.py</i>.

To use the project-
1. Place the bikeshare.py file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
1. Place the <i>bikeshare.py</i> file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
2. Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.

## Resources
